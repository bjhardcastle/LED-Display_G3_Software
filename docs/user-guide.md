# User Guide

The User guide is intended to provide a less technical introduction to the system from a user's (rather than a developer's) perspective. The goal of the Panels system development was to establish the system at a level where users would need to understand some of the basic logic of the implementation, but could be informed and productive users, without ever needing to read or modify the underlying C code. For information on how to assemble the arenas, see the [Panels Generation 3 Hardware site](https://github.com/reiserlab/Panel-G3-Hardware) and the [Arenas Page](https://github.com/reiserlab/Panel-G3-Hardware/wiki/Arenas).

As of April 2011, this documentation for the Panel Controller V3.0 is rapidly being updated. The primary location for this documentation will be this Wiki. In the meantime the existing user guide for PDC 2.0 is available [here](https://github.com/reiserlab/Panel-G3-Software/blob/master/assets/flight_simulator_user_guide3.doc). This document was written by Mark Frye, Michael Reiser, and Michael Dickinson, and was primarily used as a guide to students in the [Neural System and Behavior Course](http://sites.google.com/site/nsbmbl/). Please note that this document is not written for the new controller.

This page is also being used to keep track of things that have been confusing to new users:

- 'sync SD info' feature is to sync the SD info. on a PC with the info on a card. This might be confusing.
- how to deal with multiple busses and new\old arenas
- Panel firmware version needs to be new and should install w. the bootloader. Otherwise some features won't work.
